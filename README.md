DataBase design projects that were designed and implemented for the CS6360 course at The University of Texas at Dallas.
Project1:
  Library Management System:
      Constructed an interactive web interface through which the librarian can search, Check-in/Out books. 
      It can also manage the fines levied on books. New borrowers can be added to the system. 
      A system with over 25000 books can be searched for given the title or author or even the ISBN.
Project2b:
  Database Files and Indexing:
      The goal of this project was to implement a rudimentary database engine that is loosely based on a hybrid between MySQL and SQLite. 
      This database supported actions on a single table at a time, no joins or nested queries.
      Like MySQL's InnoDB data engine (SDL), this program used file-per-table approach to physical storage. 
      Each database table was physically stored as a separate file and each table was sub-divided into logical sections of fixed equal size call pages.
